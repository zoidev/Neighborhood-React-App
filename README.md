# Neighborhood React App for Udacity 
This app was created from scratch as the final project of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program. It is a location app for the hotels in Thessaloniki, Greece.
## Live Demo

## Geting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for reviewing and developmet purposes. 
## Functionality 
The app loads the map of Thessaloniki with preloaded and pinned the hotels of the town. The user has the ability to navigate through the map, click to markers and see the name and address of the hotel. On the left up corner there is a menu button which allows the user to display a search bar and search by hotel name. Every time a location from search results is clicked, the map is centered to this location and the InfoWindow opens.
